Program will calculate the Huffman codes for a given paragraph from a file
called “paragraph.txt”.

For each character (including whitespaces) program will construct the Huffman Tree and determine the Huffman Codes. 

For each character program will write the character and the codes into a file called “huffman_codes.txt”. 

Codes in the file will be ordered according to their length. (Shorter codes should appear at the top of the file)

Ex:

E: 0 0 0

B: 0 0 1 0

H: 0 1 0 1
